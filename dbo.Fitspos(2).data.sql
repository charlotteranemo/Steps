Why do we say that? Well, fitness freaks (perhaps like yourself?) usually praise vegetables, but what about less-fitness freaks? Children? Anyone that doesn&rsquo;t diet?</p><p>Vegetables are in many cases seen as something boring to eat that you just &lsquo;have&rsquo; to eat in order to please your conscience. What if we could make vegetables fun, then maybe more people would enjoy eating and cooking them!</p><p>We have a few tips on how to get more veggies into your diet in a more&hellip; inspiring way.</p><p><strong>Realise there is more than one flavour to vegetables</strong></p><p>This is a big one. All of us here at Steps agree that when we think about vegetables, we think of them as this one side dish. But potatoes, rice, pasta and so on are also side dishes, but not grouped together in the same way as vegetables are. If you agree to see all the different vegetables as individual flavours, we can make our plates burst of taste. And the colours! If nothing else, they make the plate look pretty. Instagram, anyone?</p><p><strong>Eat the vegetables that you like</strong></p><p>So, when you think of veggies as separate parts of a meal, you can start picking out which ones you like the most. Try and get at least one green and one red vegetable on your plate at any meal, because different coloured veggies have different nutrients in them. Other than that, just eat the vegetables that you like! Are you a carrot freak? Or do you swear by iceberg lettuce? Go ahead, stock up on those! And make sure to eat them, too, because old, soggy veg are definitely a bore.</p><p><strong>Season them</strong></p><p>Yes, you can season vegetables! We are not talking oils in salads, no, normal seasoning works like a charm. If you like garlic, try and put some garlic, perhaps thyme and rosemary on your boiled carrots. Pepper your tomatoes and cucumbers. And, if a drizzle of olive oil on your lettuce will brighten your day &ndash; go ahead!</p><p><em>So, how will you eat your next vegetable? Remember, you can eat veggies as snacks, too!</em></p>', <Binary Data>)

Here we have a few alternatives to the old yogurt and muesli. Enjoy!</p><ol><li><strong>Porridge with fruit</strong><br />300 ml of milk of your choice, mixed with 40grams of rolled oats. Heat slowly on the stove until boiling. Salt to taste, and top with fruit.</li><li><strong>Overnight oats with peanut butter</strong><br />Overnight oats are usually eaten cold, and they are great for on-the-go as you can prepare them the night before and just take out the fridge in the morning. Mix equal parts (e.g 150ml milk, 150ml oats) of rolled oats and milk and for this recipe, mix in a spoon of peanut butter. Pour into a sealable container and put in the fridge overnight.</li><li><strong>Scrambled eggs</strong><br />We don&#39;t think this needs an explanation, but it deserves a spot on this list for the health benefits and, not the least, the taste! Mix two or three eggs, add a pinch of salt, and then fry them while strirring in the pan so that you get a nice, creamy scramble.</li><li><strong>Banana pancakes</strong><br />This is a real treat. You mix 2 ripe, mushed bananas with 3 eggs, a sprinkle of cinnamon and 1/8 teaspoon baking powder. Fry like normal pancakes for about 4 minutes on each side, and then endulge.</li></ol><p>Breakfast is our favourite meal of the day, make it yours too!</p>', <Binary Data>)

The thing is, though, you don&#39;t need to do breathing exercises to relax. Yes, sometimes they can be helpful, but there are other ways.</p><p>For example, try and relax by scheduling in some &quot;me-time&quot; in your hectic life. With this we mean like a yoga session, a couple of hours of going to the cinema (when there&#39;s no covid, of course) by yourself or with someone you love or why not a cooking class? Anything that can let you take a break from work, cleaning, washing, studying... You name it.</p><p>We need to learn to relax, because overstressing is a real thing. It can make you unable to do the things you love, like exercising and spending quality time with your family for example, and instead bring lots of negativity into your life. We don&#39;t want that, do we?</p><p>So take some time to breathe. Not necessarily doing breathing exercises, maybe just normal exercising would work for you? Try the things you can to relieve stress, and we are almost sure that you will become more productive in your everyday life.</p>', <Binary Data>)
